# J--
An extremely tiny interpreter written in JS for learning purposes only.

- JS is itself interpreted by browser engines written in C++.
- C++ is written in C++ (bootstrapping) and is compiled to native code (assembly).
- the assembly code runs through an assembler that converts it into binary code (0,1).
- binary code is processed by logic gates
- beyond this is electronics and beyond that is physics.
